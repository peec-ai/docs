<Info>
  In some cases, a domain’s visibility score can exceed 100%. This happens when multiple URLs from the same domain are used as sources in a single AI response. 

  When this occurs, the domain is **overrepresented** because it contributes more than once to the result, leading to a visibility score above 100%.

## Why sources matter

When AI models generate responses, they pull information from various websites across the internet. Understanding these sources helps you:

- **Identify trusted content:** see which websites AI models cite most frequently
- **Find optimization opportunities:** discover if your content appears in sources but isn't being cited directly in AI answers
- **Track competitive sources:** monitor which websites your competitors use or appear on

**Important:** A source can be used without being cited. Your content might contribute to an AI's response even if it's not explicitly referenced in the final answer.

## How to use source insights

Source data helps you make strategic decisions about your content and outreach:

- **Find partnership opportunities:** identify high-performing sources where you might want to get your brand mentioned
- **Improve your content strategy:** learn from successful sources to improve how you structure and present your information
- **Discover content gaps:** see what topics and formats perform well that you might be missing

### Filters and controls

Use these filters to get a closer look at which domains and URLs are being used by narrowing down your data:

- **Date range:** view data for different time periods (default is last 7 days)
- **Tags:** filter by specific prompt tags you’ve created
- **Brand:** filter by your brand or tracked competitors
- **Models:** filter by specific AI models
