<Info>
  In some cases, a domain’s visibility score can exceed 100%. This happens when multiple URLs from the same domain are used as sources in a single AI response.

  When this occurs, the domain is **overrepresented** because it contributes more than once to the result, leading to a visibility score above 100%.

## Why sources matter

When AI models generate responses, they pull information from various websites across the internet. Understanding these sources helps you:

- **Identify trusted content:** See which websites AI models cite most frequently.
- **Find optimization opportunities:** Discover if your content appears in sources but isn't being cited directly in AI answers.
- **Track competitive sources:** Monitor which websites your competitors use or appear on.

**Important:** A source can be used without being cited. Your content might contribute to an AI's response even if it's not explicitly referenced in the final answer.

## How to use source insights

Source data helps you make strategic decisions about your content and outreach:

- **Find partnership opportunities:** Identify high-performing sources where you might want to get your brand mentioned.
- **Improve your content strategy:** Learn from successful sources to improve how you structure and present your information.
- **Discover content gaps:** See what topics and formats perform well that you might be missing.

### Source classification

Classification of source domains:

- **UGC**: User-generated content and social media sites (such as YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook). Also includes sites where the main content is added by users (such as reddit and G2).
- **Editorial**: Sites where the majority of content is created by a limited number of editors. Mainly news and media publishers (such as CNN or the New York Times) and blogs.
- **Corporate**: Corporate websites (such as Peec AI or BMW). Also commercial websites and online shops (such as Walmart or Target).
- **Reference**: Reference websites (such as Wikipedia or Encyclopedia Britannica), including dictionaries (such as Merriam-Webster).
- **Institutional**: Institutional and governmental websites, as well as universities.
- **Other**: Websites that don't fit neatly into the above categories. This includes classifieds, unclassified websites, websites that span multiple categories, and major platforms (such as Google, Bing, and CDNs).
