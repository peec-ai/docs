**This isn't like traditional SEO keyword tracking.** Your results will take time to become statistically meaningful, and data may vary day-to-day since AI models are inherently random.

## Why prompts matter

AI models don’t rely on keywords — people ask full questions. Instead of searching "best running shoes," they ask "What are the best running shoes for marathon training under \$200?"

Visibility in AI means appearing in those conversations either as a **named brand** or by having your content **used or cited**.

Prompts simulate real questions your audience might ask. Peec AI runs them across multiple AI models once every 24 hours, giving you fresh insights on how the models respond and who they highlight.

## Two ways to add prompts

Navigate to **Prompts** in your sidebar. From here, you can:

### 1. Use prompt suggestions

Our suggestion engine proposes prompts based on:

- Your website
- Industry context
- Existing prompts in your workspace

You can accept, reject, or ask for more suggestions.

Go to the **Suggested** tab to see suggested prompts. Click to **Reject** or **Accept** them. Any accepted prompts will get added to the **Active** prompts tab.

If you don’t see any suggestions, click the **Generate suggestion** button.

### 2. Add prompts manually

Click **Add** in the top-right of the Prompts page. You can:

- Add one or more prompts (use new line for each new prompt).
- In **IP Address**, set the country you want each prompt to run from.

Note: Each prompt can be up to 200 characters. When adding multiple prompts, the counter shows the length of your longest prompt.

If your desired country isn't available, contact us and we'll add it in the next update.

## Tagging your prompts

Tags help you organize prompts around themes, funnel stages, locations, or product areas — so you can analyze performance in isolation.

For example, you could compare visibility for "email marketing" prompts versus "social media marketing" prompts, or compare German prompts versus US prompts.

### How to tag prompts

- Add/edit tags by clicking the **Tag** column in the prompt table.
- Use **bulk tagging** by selecting multiple prompts and clicking **Assign Tags.**

## Reading your prompts dashboard

The **Prompts** page shows all your prompts and their performance data. Here's what you'll see:

### Dashboard overview

- **Next prompt cycle:** timer showing when the next 24-hour prompt run begins
- **Prompt usage:** shows how many active prompts you're using vs. your plan limit
- **Active/Inactive tabs:** switch between running prompts and archived ones
- **Suggested prompts:** generated prompt recommendations

**Note:** Only active prompts count toward your prompt limit. Inactive prompts are archived but don't use your quota — a great way to experiment with new prompts while staying within your plan.

### Filters and controls

- **Tags filter:** filter prompts by specific or all tags
- **Brand filter:** view prompts for your brand or specific (or all) competitors
- **Add button:** create new prompts manually

### Prompt performance table

Each prompt shows:

- **Position:** average ranking when your brand appears in AI answers (lower is better)
- **Sentiment:** score from 1-100 based on how positively you're mentioned (higher is better)
- **Visibility:** percentage of responses where your brand appeared
- **Top:** icons showing the top 3 competitors mentioned for this prompt (hover to see exact percentages)
- **Tags:** prompt categories for organization (click to create or add new tags)
- **Geo:** country where the prompt is run from (geo proxies available for ChatGPT and AI Overviews only)
- **Created:** when the prompt was added

## Managing your prompts

### Individual prompt actions

For single prompts, you can:

- **Archive prompts:** Select your prompt and click **Disable** to turn it inactive while keeping historical data.
- **Edit tags:** Click into **Tags** in the table to add or remove tags for specific prompts.

### Bulk prompt actions

Select multiple prompts using the checkboxes to:

- **Group assign tags:** Add tags to several prompts at once.
- **Group disable:** Turn multiple prompts inactive simultaneously.

### Export prompt performance data

Scroll to the bottom of all active or inactive prompts to download a CSV file containing the last 7 days of data for each set.

**Next:** Once your prompts are running, learn how to interpret your results.
