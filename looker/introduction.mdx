## What is the Peec AI Looker Studio connector?

The Peec AI Looker Studio community connector lets you import your AI search visibility data directly into [Google Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/). You can then create custom dashboards and reports using your brand performance data from AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini.

<Note>
  Looker Studio is Google's free data visualization tool that helps you turn your data into informative, easy-to-read, and shareable dashboards and reports.
