## Two ways to add competitors

Navigate to **Competitors** in your sidebar. From here, you can:

### 1. Use suggested competitors

Peec AI automatically flags companies that appear often in your prompt responses. You can:

- **Accept:** Click the checkmark to add them as a competitor.
- **Reject:** Click the X to remove them.
- **Edit:** Click the pencil icon to edit name or domain before adding.

Each suggestion shows how many times that brand has been mentioned across your prompts.

### 2. Add competitors manually

Navigate to the **Competitors** page and use the **Create Competitor** form:

- **Name:** Enter the competitorâ€™s brand name as it typically appears in AI responses.
- **Domain:** Add their main website domain (used to detect source citations).
- Click **Add** to save.
