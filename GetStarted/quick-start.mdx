## Introduction

Your audience isn‚Äôt just using Google anymore. They‚Äôre turning to AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google‚Äôs AI Overviews to ask questions, compare options, and make purchase decisions. Peec helps you understand how your brand shows up in those conversations ‚Äî and how you compare to competitors.

With Peec, you can:

- Track if and how your brand is mentioned in AI-generated answers
- See which sources AI models use for answers (and whether those sources include your content)
- Monitor competitor performance
- Learn how to improve your visibility

Let‚Äôs walk through how to set things up.

## Setting Up Your Prompts

Prompts are the foundation of Peec. Everything we analyze starts with the questions you define.

### Why Prompts Matter

AI models don‚Äôt rely on keywords ‚Äî people ask full questions. Visibility in AI means appearing in those conversations either as a **named brand** or by having your content **used or cited**.

Prompts simulate real questions your audience might ask. Peec runs them across multiple AI models once every 24 hours, giving you fresh insights on how the models respond and who they highlight.

### Two Ways to Add Prompts

1. **Use Prompt Suggestions**

Our suggestion engine proposes prompts based on:

- Your website
- Industry context
- Existing prompts in your workspace

You can accept, reject, or ask for more suggestions.

2. **Add Prompts Manually** 

Click **‚ÄúAdd‚Äù** in the top-right of the Prompts page. You can:

- Add one or more prompts (use new lines)
- Set the country you want each prompt to run from
