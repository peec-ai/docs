## Introduction

Your audience isn’t just using Google anymore. They’re turning to AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google’s AI Overviews to ask questions, compare options, and make purchase decisions. Peec helps you understand how your brand shows up in those conversations — and how you compare to competitors.

With Peec, you can:

- Track if and how your brand is mentioned in AI-generated answers
- See which sources AI models use for answers (and whether those sources include your content)
- Monitor competitor performance
- Learn how to improve your visibility

Let’s walk through how to set things up.
