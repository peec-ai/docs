## Step 1: Set up your Workspace

<Info>
  **The workspace name must exactly match your brand.**

  It is the term we use when analyzing responses, so it’s important that it reflects your actual brand.

  You’ll also see your brand listed under “Competitors” because our system treats your brand as one of the competitors during the analysis process.
</Info>

Define your brand basics in the **Workspace** settings:

- **Brand name:** the name of the brand exactly as you want us to look for it in AI responses
- **Domain:** brand’s main website domain
- **IP Address:** choose where to run prompts from
- **Models:** select which AI models to track based on your plan

## Step 2: Create your first prompts

Prompts are the actual questions people type into ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google, and other AI tools — they're essential for generating your data.

For example, "What project management tool would be best for a remote team of 10 people with a tight budget?"

Navigate to the **Prompts** page in your sidebar and start with 3-5 questions where you’d want your brand to appear.

Quick start options:

- **Use suggestions:** Accept prompts we generate based on your website and industry.
