## Introduction

Your audience isn’t just using Google anymore. They’re turning to AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google’s AI Overviews to ask questions, compare options, and make purchase decisions. Peec helps you understand how your brand shows up in those conversations — and how you compare to competitors.

With Peec, you can:

- Track if and how your brand is mentioned in AI-generated answers
- See which sources AI models use for answers (and whether those sources include your content)
- Monitor competitor performance
- Learn how to improve your visibility

Let’s walk through how to set things up.

## Setting Up Your Prompts

Prompts are the foundation of Peec. Everything we analyze starts with the questions you define.

**Why Prompts Matter**

AI models don’t rely on keywords — people ask full questions. Visibility in AI means appearing in those conversations either as a **named brand** or by having your content **used or cited**.

Prompts simulate real questions your audience might ask. Peec runs them across multiple AI models once every 24 hours, giving you fresh insights on how the models respond and who they highlight.

**Two Ways to Add Prompts**

1. **Use Prompt Suggestions**

Our suggestion engine proposes prompts based on:

- Your website
- Industry context
- Existing prompts in your workspace

You can accept, reject, or ask for more suggestions.

2. **Add Prompts Manually**

Click **“Add”** in the top-right of the Prompts page. You can:

- Add one or more prompts (use new lines)
- Set the country you want each prompt to run from

📸 **Image suggestion:** UI showing prompt add modal, with prompt suggestions and country selection dropdown visible.

## Tagging Your Prompts

Tags help you organize prompts around themes, funnel stages, locations, or product areas — so you can analyze results more meaningfully.

**How to Tag Prompts**

- Add/edit tags by clicking the **tag column** in the prompt table
- Manage tag names and colors in the **Tags tab**
- Use **bulk tagging** by selecting multiple prompts and clicking **“Assign Tags”**

📸 **Image suggestion:** Prompt table with checkboxes and tag column highlighted, plus bulk tag modal open.

## Adding Competitors

Peec lets you monitor competitors using the same visibility metrics — so you can see who AI is promoting alongside (or instead of) you.

**1. Manually**

Go to the **Competitors** section and click **“Add competitor”**:

- Input brand name (as it typically appears in responses)
- Add main domain (used to detect source citations)

**2. From Suggestions**

Peec automatically flags companies that appear often in the responses. You can:

- ✅ Accept (checkmark)
- ❌ Reject (X icon)
- ✏️ Edit name/domain before confirming (pencil icon)

Your own brand also appears in the competitor list (in bold) — this is expected, as our infrastructure treats all tracked brands equally for comparison.

📸 **Image suggestion:** Competitor suggestion cards with action icons shown.

## Understanding Your Dashboard

The Dashboard is where you see how you're performing based on the prompts that ran during the last 24 hours.

Peec automatically refreshes your data once per day — and everything you see reflects aggregated results from the most recent prompt run.

**Key Components**

- **Date Selector:** Switch between single days or time ranges
- **Tag Filter:** Focus on specific themes or stages
- **Competitor Filter:** Compare visibility for selected brands
- **Model Selector:** View results from ChatGPT, Perplexity, or AI Overviews
- **Timer:** See when the next 24h cycle will begin
- **Recent Mentions:** Shows where your brand appeared in AI answers
- **Industry Ranking Table:** Lists all tracked brands, ranked by visibility

📸 **Image suggestion:** Annotated screenshot of the dashboard with filters, timer, and ranking table labeled.

## Metrics Overview

Every prompt you define results in daily responses from AI models. We analyze those responses to extract two core types of visibility:

**Brand Visibility vs Source Visibility**

Understanding the difference between these two is critical:

- **Brand Visibility** = your brand is **explicitly mentioned** in the response.
- **Source Visibility** = your **domain or content** was used or cited — even if your brand isn’t named.

> You can be visible as a source without being visible as a brand.
>
> And you can be **mentioned as a brand** without your website being used.

Peec tracks both so you can spot gaps. For example:

- If you're cited often but never mentioned, it may mean your brand lacks authority or name recognition.
- If you're mentioned often but never cited, AI might associate your name with a topic, but not trust your content as a reference.

**Brand Metrics**

Visibility Score

→ % of responses where your brand is mentioned

Sentiment

→ Score from 1 to 100 based on tone (higher = more positive)

Position

→ Average ranking of your brand in the answer (e.g. mentioned first, second, etc.)

**Source Metrics**

Used

→ % of responses where your content contributed to the AI’s answer (even without a citation)

Avg. Citations

→ Average number of explicit links to your content in the response

🔍 Source = your domain or URLs.

🟡 A source can be used silently (informing the AI’s answer) or cited visibly (appearing in the UI).

📸 **Image suggestion:** Side-by-side view of a response showing (1) brand mention, (2) source citation, highlighting that they don’t always overlap.
