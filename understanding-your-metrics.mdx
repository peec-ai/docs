Peec AI tracks two main types of visibility: when your brand is mentioned and when your content is used as a source.

Each type has different metrics that help you understand your performance.

## Brand visibility vs source visibility

Understanding the difference between these two is important:

- **Brand visibility:** Your brand is explicitly mentioned in the response.
- **Source visibility:** Your domain or content was used or cited — even if your brand isn't named.

You can be visible as a source without being visible as a brand. And you can be mentioned as a brand without your website being used.

Peec AI tracks both so you can spot gaps. For example:

- If you're cited often but never mentioned, it might mean your brand lacks authority or name recognition.
- If you're mentioned often but never cited, AI might associate your name with a topic, but not trust your content as a reference.

## Brand metrics

These appear on your **Dashboard** and throughout Peec AI:

### Position

Average ranking of your brand in the answer (e.g., mentioned first, second, etc.).

### Sentiment

The sentiment score measures the overall tone of a prompt’s response on a scale from 0 to 100. Most scores fall between 65 and 85. A score near 85 indicates clearly positive language - words like “trusted,” “reliable,” or “innovative.” Around 65 represents neutral or factual language with little emotional tone. Anything below 65 generally signals language that could be critical or negative and typically warrants a closer look.

### Visibility score

Percentage of chats (AI responses) where your brand is mentioned.

## Source metrics

You'll see basic source data on your **Dashboard**, with more detailed information available on the **Sources** page:

### Used

Percentage of responses where your content contributed to the AI's answer (even without a citation). Visible on both **Dashboard** and **Sources** page.

### Average citations

Average number of times a specific source is explicitly cited within a single response. For example, one AI response might cite the same source 3 times. Available on the **Sources** page.

**Note:** A source can be used silently (informing the AI's answer) or cited visibly (appearing in the response). Your domain or URLs can contribute to responses even when not explicitly referenced.

## Where to analyze your metrics

You can view your brand and source metrics at different levels:

- **Dashboard:** Aggregated view across all prompts and competitors.
- **Prompts page:** Individual prompt performance and trends.
- **Sources page:** Source analysis with URL and domain views.
- **By tags:** Filter any view by prompt categories to analyze specific themes.
