Peec AI tracks two main types of visibility: when your brand is mentioned and when your content is used as a source.

Each type has different metrics that help you understand your performance.

## Brand visibility vs source visibility

Understanding the difference between these two is important:

- **Brand visibility:** your brand is explicitly mentioned in the response
- **Source visibility:** your domain or content was used or cited â€” even if your brand isn't named

You can be visible as a source without being visible as a brand. And you can be mentioned as a brand without your website being used.

Peec AI tracks both so you can spot gaps. For example:

- If you're cited often but never mentioned, it might mean your brand lacks authority or name recognition.
- If you're mentioned often but never cited, AI might associate your name with a topic, but not trust your content as a reference.

## Brand metrics

These appear on your **Dashboard** and throughout Peec AI:

### Position

Average ranking of your brand in the answer (e.g., mentioned first, second, etc.).

### Sentiment

Score from 1 to 100 based on how positively you're mentioned (higher = more positive). Sentiment analyzes the words and tone surrounding your brand name in AI responses to see how well your brand is perceived.

### Visibility score

Percentage of chats (AI responses) where your brand is mentioned.

## Source metrics

You'll see basic source data on your **Dashboard**, with more detailed information available on the **Sources** page:

### Used

Percentage of responses where your content contributed to the AI's answer (even without a citation). Visible on both **Dashboard** and **Sources** page.

### Average citations

Average number of times a specific source is explicitly cited within a single response. For example, one AI response might cite the same source 3 times. Available on the **Sources** page.

**Note:** A source can be used silently (informing the AI's answer) or cited visibly (appearing in the response). Your domain or URLs can contribute to responses even when not explicitly referenced.

## Where to analyze your metrics

You can view your brand and source metrics at different levels:

- **Dashboard:** aggregated view across all prompts and competitors
- **Prompts page:** individual prompt performance and trends
- **Sources page:** source analysis with URL and domain views
- **By tags:** filter any view by prompt categories to analyze specific themes
