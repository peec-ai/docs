# Intro to Peec AI

Your audience isn't just using Google anymore. They're asking ChatGPT or Claude for product recommendations, using Perplexity for research, getting answers from Grok, and using AI overviews to learn about topics and compare options.

People are having conversations with AI instead of searching with keywords. This means visibility works differently now.

**Peec AI shows you how your brand appears in AI search.**

## What Peec AI Does

We track whether your brand appears when people ask AI tools questions about your industry, products, or the problems you solve.

Peec AI works for any business wanting to understand their AI search presence. Individual companies tracking their own visibility or agencies monitoring multiple clients.

Visibility happens in two ways:

- **Brand mentions:** your company is named in AI responses
- **Source citations:** your content is used or referenced, even without naming your brand

We run your prompts daily across multiple AI models. This gives you reliable data on how often you appear compared to competitors.

## How Peec AI Helps

- **Track AI visibility:** See when you're mentioned in relevant conversations across different AI models.
- **Monitor competitors:** Understand who else appears in your space and how often.

- **Spot content gaps:** Identify when you're cited as a source but not mentioned as a brand.
- **Track trends over time:** Monitor how your visibility changes as AI models evolve.
- **Make data-driven decisions:** Use probability-based insights for your strategy.
- **Understand AI behavior:** Learn which content types and sources perform best.
- **Optimize your approach:** Focus efforts on prompts and topics that matter most.
